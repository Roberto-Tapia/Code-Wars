// Training JS #26: methods of arrayObject---map()

// Task
// Coding in function isolateIt. function accept 1 parameters arr, it's a string array. Your task is to put a character "|" into the middle of each element.

// If the string length is an even number, use the insert method. for example: "abcd" should became "ab|cd". "|" should be inserted between ab and cd.

// If the string length is an odd number, use the replacement method. for example: "abcde" should became "ab|de". Character c will be replaced by |.

// The original array should not be changed, you need to return a new array(if you use the map method, you do not need to worry about this).

let isolateIt = arr => arr.map(s => s.slice(0, s.length / 2) + "|" + s.slice(-s.length / 2))
